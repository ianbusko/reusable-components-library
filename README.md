# reusable-components-library
A reusable library of .NET Core ViewComponents that can be loaded from an external assembly such as Nuget.

## Requirements
This class library should accomplish a few goals. It should:
* Be resuable and self-contained.
* Be Testable. Components should be strongly-typed.
* Be Simple. I want to find an easy way to load components into a new site. 
* Provide Support for scripts and styles. This may not be accomplished through the Library itself.

## Process
### Setting up View Components in an External Library
